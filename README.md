To turn on the app, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the frontend project.
3. Run the following command to start the frontend:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  Or to build the frontend, you can run:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This will build the app in the backend directory, and then all you have to do is run the backend, and the whole app runs.

4. Open another terminal.
5. Navigate to the root directory of the backend project.
6. Run the following command to start the backend:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

Once both the frontend and backend are running, you should be able to access the app in your browser.
